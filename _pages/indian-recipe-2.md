<ul>
 	<li class="instruction">Wash and soak rajma for 8 to 10 hours in ample water. If you prefer to pressure cook them first, you can do it for 3 to 4 whistles on a medium flame with 2 cups of water.</li>
 	<li class="instruction">Heat a pan with oil and saute cumin until it sizzles.</li>
 	<li class="instruction">Saute ginger garlic paste until a nice aroma comes out.</li>
 	<li class="instruction">Add onions or paste and saute until it turns golden.</li>
 	<li class="instruction">Saute tomatoes or puree until the raw smell vanishes.</li>
 	<li class="instruction">Add all the spice powders and salt. Saute until oil begins to leave.</li>
 	<li class="instruction">Add kidney beans and pour water. Pressure cook on a medium flame for 1 whistle. Reduce the flame to low and pressure cook for 2 whistles. When the pressure goes off, open the lid and stir.</li>
 	<li class="instruction">If you have pressure cooked them already in the first step, then you can add them here along with left over stock. Simmer for 10 to 15 mins.</li>
 	<li class="instruction">Check if they are done completely.</li>
 	<li class="instruction">Sprinkle some coriander leaves. Serve rajma masala with onion and lemon wedges.</li>
