<ul>
 	<li>In a medium-sized pot, cook the black fungus and celery in boiling water for 3-4 minutes.</li>
 	<li>Drain andÂ rinse under cold running water to cool them completely. Set aside and let any excess water drain off. You can also use a salad spinner to get rid of the excess water.</li>
 	<li>In a large bowl, mix together the garlic, vinegar, light soy sauce, and olive oil. Next, add the black fungus and celery and mix well. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
 	<li>Make sure to stir and mixture<span style="color: #555555; font-size: 17px;"> again before serving, as the sauce tends to settle to the bottom.</span></li>
