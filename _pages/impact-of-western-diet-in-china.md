	<p style="text-align: justify;">In November 1987, KFC launched a sub-branch in Qianmen, Beijing, becoming the first western fast food company in the Chinese market. After Thirty years development, it now becomes the Chinese largest restaurant chain. KFC offers customers fried chicken, a typical Western-style fast food. The food is calorically dense, has highly refined carbohydrates, features meat or processed meat with high sodium, cholesterol and has a bad dietary fatty acid. Historical evidence indicates western-style fast food intake raises the incidence of getting cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There's an exciting paper indicates that (Odegaard, Koh, Yuan, Gross, Mark &amp; Pereira, 2012, p. 182) younger generation are more prefer Western-style fast food. People who take Western-style fast food more frequently usually consuming fewer vegetables, less dietary fiber as well as less dairy products. However, Dietary Guidelines for American 2015-2020 published by USDA suggested that the intake of saturated fat should be restricted to 10% of total calorie. Also, WHO suggests that a minimum of 400g of fruit and veg should be eaten every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following are three tables regarding the relationship between Western-style fast food </p><p style="text-align: justify;">monthly intake with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Mortality.</p>
Table 1 shows the characteristics according to Intake Frequency of Western-Style Fast Food. We can see female prefer Western-Style Fast Food than male. People who have higher frequency intake of fast food not tend to do physical activity in usual. Besides, they tend to intake more red meats, sodium, and less carbohydrate source food as well as dietary fiber food. Also, more saturated fat and cholesterol intake is another typical major feature differ from No Intake participants.

<p style="text-align: left;">Evidence shows that regular Western-style fast food intake contributes to type 2 diabetes, weight gain, and cardiovascular risk. Related research indicates that regular meats intake will increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and CHD, especially for red meat and high-fat dairy protein sources. Moreover, it indicates that the blood glucose could be affected by fried potatoes and processed grains central to most Western-style fast food intake is components that could increase the risk of diabetes and CHD. The decreasing dietary fiber intake may also contribute to cardiometabolic risk. Others have proposed that the high sodium in most Western-style fast foods be another factor leading to CHD. Furthermore, trans fatty acids, considered as the main component of fast food, which could raise harmful (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower right (HDL) cholesterol levels. Eating trans fats increases the risk of developing heart disease and stroke.</p>
