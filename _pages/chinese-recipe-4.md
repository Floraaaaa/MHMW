<ul>
 	<li>Toast millet in the bottom of the pan or skillet over medium-high heat for 5 – 8 minutes, until some aroma begins to waft.</li>
 	<li>In the meantime, bring water to a boil. How much you use depends on how thick you want your porridge.</li>
 	<li>Add millet to boiling water and boil over medium-high to low heat for 15 – 25 minutes, until done. It will not absorb all the water, but some color and starch will be released to let you know as cooking finishes.</li>
 	<li>Eat warm, adding sugar or honey to taste</li>
</ul>
