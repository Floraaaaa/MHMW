	<p style="text-align: justify;">It is significant for people who are suffering from diabetes engage themselves exercise regularly to keep healthy. It is because people can control blood sugar and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by doing resistance training. In fact, muscles require more glucose than those that are resting when doing resistance workout.<br /> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zhMOqUDsKew" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />Moreover, it is reported by ASCM that muscle movement recruits greater sugar uptake by muscle cells and lower blood sugar levels. With long-time consistency exercise, users will get additional advantage including a healthier heart, better weight control, and stress management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>So，what specific exercise should we do?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">National Health Service(NHS), a UK healthcare organization provides structured care for people with diabetes of every type and at every stage. NHS suggests that people should do moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 150 minutes a week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aerobic activity at moderate intensity means exercising at a level that raises people heart rate and makes them sweat. It includes a multitude of sports. For example:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Fast paced walking</li>
</ul>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Light jogging</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-823" src="http://35.201.22.184/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Fast-paced-walking-300x280.png" alt="" width="300" height="280" /></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Bike riding</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-825" src="http://35.201.22.184/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bike-riding-181x300.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="300" /></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Rowing</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-827" src="http://35.201.22.184/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rowing-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" /></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Playing doubles tennis or badminton</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1682" src="http://35.201.22.184/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20-300x219.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="219" /></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Swimming</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-829" src="http://35.201.22.184/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Swimming-259x300.png" alt="" width="259" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides exercises we suggested above, uesrs can do light activities like housework, including Cutting the grass, cleaning home, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alternatively, other daily chores such as shopping, washing dishes are good alternative choices. As technology developed so much at present, making these activities far less demanding on the body than previous generations, who were active naturally more active through work and manual labor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the less time you spend sitting down, the better it will be for your health. Inactive behavior, such as sitting or lying down for an extended period, will increase your risk of weight gain as well as obesity, which in turn, may also up your risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.</p>
